# Pomodoro Clock

This project was made using React (Hooks) and components of the antd-library (https://ant.design/components/overview/).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Play around with the clock by setting sessions and breaks. Smallest break & session time is one minute, however you can increase both as much as you want. 
An alarm sound will automatically play between sessions and breaks. 

Hope you enjoy it!
